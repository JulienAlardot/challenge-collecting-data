## Contributors

The group working on this project is composed of:

- [Alain Tiri](https://github.com/AlainTiri)
- [Julien Alardot](https://github.com/JulienAlardot)
- [Jean-François Sengier](https://github.com/JFSengier)

We split up the sites to scraps as following : 


| Site              |                         |
| ----------------- |:----------------------- |
| Immoweb           | Alain                   |
| LogicImmo         | Julien                  |
| ImmoVlan          | Jeff                    |

We were racing all day and night toward the record of 50 000, (that we have beaten)

## Difficulties and improuvements

- We don't already past the captcha of ImmoVlan in time after trying with rotating headers, using selenium.
- We had to adapt our data to a common trunk found in the websites. Hence loosing informations.
- We could try NLP techniques to get more information and filter typos inside the code.
- Most of the websites used having receive updates, the code as is isn't working anymore.

## Timeline

From Monday 3 May to 6 May 2021

## How to use

Run the Core.database_gen.load_database() to get the final database (the file is database.csv under Data)
